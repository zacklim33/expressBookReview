# expressBookReviews 

This is a project based on IBM course, which uses a backend system (Express.JS) to manage book reviews. There are different RESTful API endpoints, with each endpoint having an associated function for users usage. 

Such functionality include: 
* getting the book list, 
* conducting searches based on the title, author, ISBN,
* user registration
* authenticating user login 
* allowing users to add, modify and delete their own book review

In this code repository, I had chosen to add async-await functionality to some RESTful API endpoints, which mimic calls to external web services with the relevant callback functions.
